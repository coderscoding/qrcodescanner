<h2>Some Things to Consider When Looking for a Free WordPress Theme</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/08/wordpress-theme-directory-1.jpg" alt="WordPress Theme Directory"/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A theme is a collection of files that govern the appearance of your site's content.&nbsp;Without a theme, the look of your website will look mediocre or even unappealing.&nbsp;Like a skinless bone, even if your site contains major components, such as content and features, it still won't look attractive because there is no "skin" that wraps around its appearance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Look for website themes that fit the topic and purpose of your website, especially for WordPress sites.&nbsp;There are several free WordPress themes (such as the themes we will show below) and there are also some premium ones (having more sophisticated paid features).&nbsp;Choosing a theme is not easy, especially there are thousands of choices available.&nbsp;However, don't worry.&nbsp;Here are a few things you need to pay attention to when looking for a suitable theme:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Main features and functions.&nbsp;</strong>Don't forget the features and functionality needed by your site while you are looking for themes.&nbsp;For example, e-commerce sites require integration with&nbsp;<em>shopping cart</em>&nbsp;plugins&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;For business themes,&nbsp;&nbsp;persuasive&nbsp;<em>landing</em>&nbsp;page templates&nbsp;might be very useful.</li><li><strong>User reviews and ratings.&nbsp;</strong>Reviews from old and new users give you an idea of ​​each theme, including its advantages and disadvantages.&nbsp;You really don't have to read every review written.&nbsp;However, these reviews help you make your decision.</li><li><strong>Continue to be updated and developed by the developer</strong>&nbsp;.&nbsp;Themes will not function optimally if there is no update process.&nbsp;Choose a theme that is always updated and developed by the developer.&nbsp;This is important so that the appearance of your site remains attractive.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To make searching easier, first make a list of what features your site needs.&nbsp;Then, look for themes that offer these features, and refine your search using the last two criteria that we have created (reviews / ratings, and updates).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The best WordPress themes for your website don't have to be expensive or paid.&nbsp;Because in fact, free WordPress themes are also as effective as premium theme options, and sometimes provide most or all of the features you want.</p>
